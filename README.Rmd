The goal of `buscadoR` is to find plant receptor proteins in information from from hmmer, deeptmhmm and BLAST to find signal peptides, repeats, transmembrane and ectodomains then applies a heuristic to classify into receptor classes. 


## Prerequisites

`buscadoR` requires input from `hmmer`, `deeptmhmm` and `BLAST`. A Google Colab notebook is available to help you run these time consuming searches easily. Go to the [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hKDLBCZQcB-wuaFjPGEyTFk0AV34AdON?usp=sharing) to run searches before proceeding. If you wish to run these locally please see the section Running `buscadoR` searches locally". 

This R package assumes that you have already performed those searches and have the necessary files to hand.

## Installation

You can install buscadoR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TeamMacLean/buscadoR")
```

## Compiling the results, classifying the proteins

The search results can be combined and the RLK classes predicted with the `buscar` function. Pass in all the input files, including the original FASTA file.

Note that you can pass either gzipped (`.gz`) files or plain text files.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(buscadoR)

fasta_file <- "arabidopsis_proteome.fa"
hmmer_file <- "hmmer_results.txt.gz"
deeptmhmm_file <- "deeptmhmm_results.txt.gz"
blast_file <- "blast_results.txt.gz"

b <- buscar(hmmer = hmmer_file, deeptmhmm = deeptmhmm_file, blast = blast_file, fasta = fasta_file)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(buscadoR)
b <- readRDS("saved.rds")
```

## Examining the results

A set of helper functions to help you extract data into a useable result is provided.

A summary table of each type found can be generated

```{r}
mesa(b)
```

A tibble (dataframe) of one row per receptor protein found (ideal for exporting) can be created

```{r}
to_tibble(b)
```


Raw search results from the databases can be extracted

```{r}
pfam_results(b)
```

also `deeptmhmm_results()`, `blast_results()`

Each set of putative proteins can be rendered as a plot

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=8}
dibujar(b, which = "TM-PROTEIN")
```

also use `LRR-RK, LRR-RP, LRR+OTHER-RK, LRR+OTHER-RP, OTHER-RK, OTHER-RP, TM-KINASE, TM-PROTEIN, unclassified_RK, unclassified_RP`

## Exporting results

A tibble (dataframe) of one row per receptor protein can be created and written out

```{r, eval=FALSE}
res <- to_tibble(b)
readr::write_csv(res, "my_results.csv")
```

Annotated FASTA sequences can be exported

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_seqs(b, "my_seqs.fa")
```

## Other Stuff

A dataframe compatible with the `drawProteins` package [here on bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/drawProteins/inst/doc/drawProteins_BiocStyle.html) can be created for further plotting work. Note the plot is a `ggplot2` object and can be styled using that package too. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dp <- as_drawProteins(b)
```

The definitions used for the classification can be returned

```{r}
definiciones()
```



## Running `buscadoR` searches locally

If you wish to run the searches locally the output formats for each program need to be set carefully to work with `buscar()`.

### `hmmer`

The PFAM domain hmms used for the `hmmer` search are provided here as a file [buscador_pfam_hmm](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/buscador_hlp/blob/main/buscador.hmm). Alternatively you can parse the latest versions from the PFAM-A database. The required IDs can be listed from `buscadoR` as they are held in the data objects `lrr_pfam`, `non_lrr_pfam` and `kinase_pfams`.

When running `hmmscan` use `--domtblout` as the output option.

### `deeptmhmm`

There are no options for `deeptmhmm`. When running this locally, a single output file is created for each sequence. Just concatenate these into one file for input into `buscar()`

### `blastp`

The ecto-domains for use as query sequence in the `blastp` are available here as a fasta [buscador_ecto_fasta](https://github.com/TeamMacLean/buscador_hlp/blob/main/At_ecto.fa)

Use `blastp` with these as the query and the proteins of interest as the subject, select `outfmt 6`. The resulting text file can be used as input to `buscar()`
