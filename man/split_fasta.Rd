\title{Split a fasta formatted file.}
\usage{
split_fasta(
  path_in,
  path_out,
  num_seq = 20000,
  trim = FALSE,
  trunc = NULL,
  id = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_in}{A path to the .FASTA formatted file that is to be processed.}

\item{path_out}{A path where the resulting .FASTA formatted files should be
stored. The path should also contain the prefix name of the fasta files on
which _n (integer from 1 to number of fasta files generated) will be appended
along with the extension ".fa"}

\item{num_seq}{Integer defining the number of sequences to be in each
resulting .fasta file. Defaults to 20000.}

\item{trim}{Logical, should the sequences be trimmed to 4000 amino acids
to bypass the CBS server restrictions. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{trunc}{Integer, truncate the sequences to this length. First 1:trunc
amino acids will be kept.}

\item{id}{Logical, should the protein id's be returned. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
if id = FALSE, A Character vector of the paths to the resulting
.FASTA formatted files.

if id = TRUE, A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{id}{Character, protein identifiers.}
\item{file_list}{Character, paths to the resulting .FASTA formatted files.}
  }
}
\description{
The function splits a fasta formatted file to a defined number of smaller
.fasta files for further processing.
}
